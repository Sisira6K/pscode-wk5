// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
//Declare two numbers
INPUT a,b 
//Add two numbers
Sum =a + b
OUTPUT Sum
END


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
//Declare a variable number
READ Number
IF Number%2==0 THEN 
	PRINT "EVEN"
ELSE 
	PRINT "ODD"
ELSEIF
END





// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

BEGIN
//Declare 5 Numbers
WRITE "Enter 5 Numbers"
READ n1,n2,n3,n4,n5
WRITE "The Average of 5 numbers"
SET avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
WRITE avg
IF (n1>n2)
SET min to n2
ELSE 
SET min to n1
IF(n3 < min)
SET min to n3
IF(n4 < min)
SET min to n4
IF(n5 < min)
SET min to n5
WRITE "The minimum value is "
WRITE min


IF(n1<n2)
SET max to n2
ELSE
SET max to n1
IF(n3>max)
SET max to n3
IF (n4>max)
SET max to n4
IF  (n5>max)
SET max to n5
WRITE "The Maximum is"
WRITE max
